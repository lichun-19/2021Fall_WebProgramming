There are mainly 5 sections in this webpage: 
navigation bar, headline, preview images, a big image, and footer.

Here are the features that you can check out:

1. **Navigation bar**: press "Home" to redirect to the Home page (which is the only page).
2. **Responsive Design**: when the screen width is smaller than 720px, (1) the font size of headline changes smaller, (2) the size proportion of arrays get larger, and (3) the arrangement of those small images changes from 1 row to 3 rows for better layout.
3. **Hover**: when you hover over the left and right arrays, the color gets brighter; when hovering over the preview images(small images), the edge glows.
